# star-animation
Short script for drawing stars and animating them, as well as animating rotating polygons which trace the stars.

The main file is a Julia script to generate an animation of the type shown in the Mathologer video on ["The 3-4-7 Miracle"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEN0o9ZGmOM). To run it, either type "julia star_animation" from command line or include() it while in a REPL. Either way it will prompt for the parameters of the star. The original example would be generated by inputting 7 and 3 for the {7/3} star. Once finished, it will save a .gif of the animation with the chosen filename. 

There is also a separate script which is a standalone version of the part that draws stars. This can be used in REPL to make cool spirograph patterns and animations. Combining different patterns and colours can create some pretty cool effects. I recommend running this one from the REPL to avoid unnecessarily recompiling things. Simply include() it and run spinstar(n) or star(n) where n is the number of stars you want to overlay. 
A list of available colours can be found [here](https://github.com/JuliaGraphics/Colors.jl/blob/master/src/names_data.jl).
